WORK-IN-PROGRESS!!!
===================
I'm still working on this library. I don't have a roadmap for it eather. I use
it in my own programs and add features in the library where I see fit. That
doesn't mean you can't use the library! Or if you don't use it, you can learn
from it and maybe make a SDL port or something ;) Hey! When you encounter a
bug let me know ok? Happy coding!
